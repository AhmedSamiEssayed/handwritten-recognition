# Handwritten Recognition
Application to classify a handwritten digits using neural networks.By using libraries like keras and tensorflow and MNIST dataset to train and test our NN.

# Datasetes Used
The MNIST database of handwritten digits, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. 
The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
